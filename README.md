A full-stack E-commerce Website. With features such as user profile management, search filter products, cart
functionality, reviews functionality, add new products(admin only), checkout functionality.

This is a single page, user interactive web application. I have used React for frontend and Redux for state management,
Node JS and Express for backend with MongoDB as database. All the dynamic data related operations are performed
through various apiâ€™s. The payment gateway is integrated using the stripe sdk. The data is stored in the NO SQL format
in the mongo-db cloud server. 

This project is deployed in vercel app and is live on this Website link https://akm-web-store-ui.vercel.app/
